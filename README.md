Hey!

I'm Jonnie Milton and this is my Portfolio Number 1 submission titled: "Angkor... WAT?"

This website is going to be a historically informative, yet casual guide to the Angkor Wat temple in Cambodia, featuring a couple stories and accounts from *Person X* 
who is being displayed as a tour guide to the temple & will feature a submission form section where users will be able to sign up for a tour guide pamphlet & newsletter.

The work for this project will be using the following technologies:

>[HTML5] 
>[CSS3] 

And will be deployed & edited using GitPod (vscode)
