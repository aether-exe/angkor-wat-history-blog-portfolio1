Hey!

I'm Jonnie Milton and this is my Portfolio Number 1 submission titled: "Angkor... WAT?"

This website is going to be a historically informative, yet casual guide to the Angkor Wat temple in Cambodia, featuring a couple stories and accounts from *Person X* 
who is being displayed as a tour guide to the temple & will feature a submission form section where users will be able to sign up for a tour guide pamphlet & newsletter.

(Design:)

The design is going to be very simplistic and clean, with an earthy / neutral colour scheme. 

(Features:)

Will feature a history section, followed by a story from someone who has travelled to the temple and a personal photo of them with a circular border radius.

The footer will contain a form for submitting an email to receive a newsletter & travel pamphlet.

The work for this project will be using the following technologies:
