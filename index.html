        <div id="angkor-text-right">Stretching over some 162.6 hectares, including forested area, Angkor Archaeological Park is the largest religious site in the world. Scattered across the park are the remains of the different capitals of the Khmer Empire. These date from the 9th to the 15th century. This includes 72 major temples and many minor temples. The most famous is the Temple of Angkor Wat and, at Angkor Thom, the Bayon Temple with its countless sculptural decorations.</div>
        <div id="angkor-text-center">In April during Khmer New Year celebrations, Freddie, a young explorer made the pilgrimage to Cambodia's most sacred mountain, Phnom Kulen. As the birthplace of the mighty Angkor Empire, fabled Kulen's gentle slopes hold a special place in the hearts of locals.
            During religious festivals, Cambodians flock to its peak to be blessed by the same waters used to coronate kings since 802 AD. This was when empire founder Jayavarman II was washed with sacred water and declared a devaraja or God King, marking the start of the Angkor Empire. The empire went on to span much of modern-day Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam, and house the world's largest pre-industrial urban hub – the city of Angkor.
            To immortalise this sacred spot that sits about 50km north of Siem Reap city, 1,000 lingas – a phallic symbol incarnation of the Hindu god Shiva – were carved into the riverbed at Kbal Spean, where water flows to the Angkor plains and into the Tonle Sap Lake. Even today, this water is regarded as sacred, and its power is believed to cure illnesses and bring luck.
            "This is a very special place for Cambodians; it's an important part of our history," said Sheng (local Cambodian). "Every year, my family visit Mount Kulen as part of our Khmer New Year rituals. We bring food donations to leave at the temple and pour water from Kbal Spean on us to bring good luck."</div>
