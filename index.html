        <div id="angkor-text-right">Stretching over some 162.6 hectares, including forested area, Angkor Archaeological Park is the largest religious site in the world. Scattered across the park are the remains of the different capitals of the Khmer Empire. These date from the 9th to the 15th century. This includes 72 major temples and many minor temples. The most famous is the Temple of Angkor Wat and, at Angkor Thom, the Bayon Temple with its countless sculptural decorations.</div>
        <div id="angkor-text-center">In April during Khmer New Year celebrations, Freddie, a young explorer made the pilgrimage to Cambodia's most sacred mountain, Phnom Kulen. As the birthplace of the mighty Angkor Empire, fabled Kulen's gentle slopes hold a special place in the hearts of locals.
            During religious festivals, Cambodians flock to its peak to be blessed by the same waters used to coronate kings since 802 AD. This was when empire founder Jayavarman II was washed with sacred water and declared a devaraja or God King, marking the start of the Angkor Empire. The empire went on to span much of modern-day Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam, and house the world's largest pre-industrial urban hub – the city of Angkor.
            To immortalise this sacred spot that sits about 50km north of Siem Reap city, 1,000 lingas – a phallic symbol incarnation of the Hindu god Shiva – were carved into the riverbed at Kbal Spean, where water flows to the Angkor plains and into the Tonle Sap Lake. Even today, this water is regarded as sacred, and its power is believed to cure illnesses and bring luck.
            "This is a very special place for Cambodians; it's an important part of our history," said Sheng (local Cambodian). "Every year, my family visit Mount Kulen as part of our Khmer New Year rituals. We bring food donations to leave at the temple and pour water from Kbal Spean on us to bring good luck."</div>

        <div id="fred-story">"In the earliest of hours in the morning of my 5th night in Siem Reap, me and my girl woke up 
             for our most anticipated adventure during our trip to Cambodia. The time was 3:30am and we were heading North to 
             see all the temples but most importantly to visit the beautiful city of Angkor Wat. We got ready by 4am and had
             a car booked to take us on our journey. After stopping to buy our temple passes in a remote building on the 
             highway we proceeded in the humid darkness towards Angkor Wat to catch the sunrise over the magical temple. 
             When we arrived, we walked across a huge floating bridge along with thousands of other people. I was in awe of 
             the size of the temple, it was truly an ancient city. As we walked in and through the stone walls toward the 
             centre we could see hundreds of bats waking from their sleep. Very creepy! Then as we drew toward the end of 
             our walk into the city we heard what could only be described as a high pitched jingle… “Coffee!” “Coffeeeeee!” 
             higher and higher each time. It was the Cambodian street sellers selling their food and drink to the tourists! 
             And in the pitch black darkness - using every sales technique in the book! Some people were upset by this but I 
             had to give them credit! I didn’t buy a coffee but later in the day saw the same man, bought some water,
             and complimented him on his jingles. We then sat and watched the beautiful sunrise over the temple. This part
             is impossible to put into words, especially when Buddhism holds such a special place in my heart, truly magical.
             As soon as I could, after the sun had shown itself on the horizon I raced up into the temple, all the way to the 
             top. To my surprise I was greeted my two Buddhist monks. One sat soaking coloured string bracelets in a bowl of 
             scented petals floating in water, and the other sat quietly meditating. I felt inclined to go and sit with them...
              so I did. One monk offered me a scented bracelet and tied it to my wrist. After asking me to hold my hands 
              together and close my eyes he then gave me a blessing for peace and good luck. It was exhilarating and very 
              special moment. We then roamed the rest of the temple for some time and then, not before finding the “Coffeeee!” 
              guy for some water of course, we left and continued on to some more temples. 
              Nothing is quite like the magical city of Angkor Wat."</div>
